# NOTE THAT IF WE GET INPUT FROM A USER PYTHON IS GOING TO CONVERT IT INTO A STRING

# There are two python functions of converting strings into a number {The first one is [int] and the second on is [float]}
# The int function is always looking for a whole number i.e when you use int with decimal number it going to bring out an error
