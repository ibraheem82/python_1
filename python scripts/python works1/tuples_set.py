# A Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# They are always inside parenthesis.
'''
# Create tuple
# fruits = ('Apples', 'Orange', 'Grapes')
# fruits2 = tuple(('Apples', 'Orange', 'Grapes'))

# Single value need a trailing comma
# fruits2 = ('Apple',)

# Get value
# print(fruits[1]);

# In tuple you can't change values you can only get the values
# fruits[0] = 'Pears'

# Deleting a tuple
# del fruits2

# Get length
# print(len(fruits))

# print(fruits2, type(fruits2))

# numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7,)
# print(numbers[5])

# A Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.

'''
# A list can also be in tuples
# Tuples are immutable which means a tuple can not be changed or modify.
# A tuple is a kind of data structure which means a container where we can store different values 
# tuples are similar to list
